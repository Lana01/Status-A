1. If you require database access: Download and install RoboMongo, it's just a convenient UI for managing the MongoDB server

2. The connection string to the MongoDB mock database is: "mongodb://45.55.154.156:27017"

3. The latest version of the database with, hopefully, all the correct schemas etc will be up by some time today (21-03)
   I pushed a picture of the database design for reference
