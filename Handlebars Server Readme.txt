1. Use "npm install" in the handlebars server directory to install the necessary dependencies for the server

2. Simply execute the batch file and the server should be up and running, I think it runs on port 5000, so:
	localhost:5000
   to access it on your browser

3. I think you should preferably copy the server out of the repo before using it.

4. Go crazy with the server
